# Quiz Game - KERROUCHE_Rayane_CDOF5

## Description

Welcome to the Quiz Game developed by **KERROUCHE_Rayane**! This game challenges your knowledge with a series of questions, and you must answer them within a limited time. If you fail to answer in time, the correct answer will be revealed, and the game will move on to the next question.

The game provides a countdown timer that shows how much time is left to answer each question. If the time limit is exceeded (10 seconds), the game automatically proceeds to the next question. The goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible before time runs out.

## Features

- **Timer**: Each question has a 10-second timer.
- **Multiple Choice**: Each question has 4 options. You need to select the correct option.
- **Feedback**: After answering, you’ll get immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct or not.
- **Score**: Your final score will be displayed at the end of the quiz, showing the number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.
- **Invalid Inputs Handling**: The game ensures the user inputs a valid option (number between 1 and 4).
